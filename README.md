# Siege Control

**Siege Control** is a 2D medieval fantasy tower defense game where players defend their kingdom against increasingly difficult waves of enemies. The game focuses on strategy, resource management, and player decision-making under pressure, creating a fun and replayable experience.

This project was built as part of a team-based CS coursework project using Godot and GDScript.

## Game Concept

Siege Control places the player in charge of defending a castle in a fantasy world. Players must place defenses, manage resources, and survive wave-based attacks from enemy soldiers and creatures. As the game progresses, enemies become more aggressive and challenging, pushing the player to adapt their strategy.

Our main design goal was to make the player *feel* the progression of the game — starting with early control, rising stress during mid-game, and a final survival challenge near the end.

## How the Game is Structured

Godot’s node-based system was used to build the game in a modular way. Each major system is broken into smaller, manageable parts, such as:

- **Player System:** Movement, sprite rendering, collision detection, and position tracking  
- **Enemy System:** movement, collision, and attack timing  
- **UI System:** Buttons, screen transitions, camera handling, and game states (pause, victory, settings)  

This structure helped keep the project organized and made debugging and feature development easier.

## My Contributions

I played a major role in both the **visual and collaborative side** of the project. I helped shape the early game concept during brainstorming, designed the castle and environment art, created UI screens and animations, and polished sound and visual feedback.
